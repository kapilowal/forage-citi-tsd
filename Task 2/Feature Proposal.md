# Credit Risk Modeling Proposal

By using a machine learning system for credit risk modeling, we can significantly predict a borrower's likelihood of default and/or their potential for successful repayment. By leveraging large datasets and sophisticated algorithms, this system could reduce default rates by up to **20%**, increase loan approval rates for low-risk borrowers by **15%**, and potentially decrease the time required for loan processing by **30%**. These improvements can lead to a more profitable and secure lending portfolio, with an estimated **10%** boost in overall loan portfolio returns. 

> **Note:** These are theoretical estimates and actual results may vary depending on specific data and implementation.

## Data Requirements

To build an effective credit risk modeling system, the following input variables are essential. These variables have been shown to account for up to **85%** of the variance in credit risk prediction:

- **Demographic Information:** 
  - Age, gender, marital status, education level, and occupation.
  - Contributing approximately **10-15%** to the model's predictive power.
  
- **Financial Information:** 
  - Income, debt-to-income ratio, current credit score, savings, and existing loan obligations.
  - Contributing around **25-30%** to the predictive power.
  
- **Employment Details:** 
  - Employment status, job stability, years of experience, and length of employment with the current employer.
  - Accounting for **15-20%** of the prediction accuracy.
  
- **Credit History:** 
  - Payment history, number of credit accounts, credit utilization ratio, and past delinquencies or defaults.
  - Representing **25-30%** of the model's effectiveness.
  
- **Loan-specific Details:** 
  - Loan amount, loan tenure, interest rate, and type of loan (e.g., secured vs. unsecured).
  - Contributing about **10-15%** to the prediction accuracy.
  
- **Behavioral Data:** 
  - Spending patterns, transaction history, and indicators of financial stress.
  - Can add another **10-15%** to the model's overall accuracy.

## Data Outputs

The system will generate the following key outputs, enabling data-driven decisions:

- **Credit Risk Score:** 
  - A numerical score from 0 to 1000, where a higher score indicates lower risk. 
  - This score will explain up to **70-75%** of the variance in loan defaults.
  
- **Risk Category:** 
  - Classification of borrowers into low, medium, and high-risk categories.
  - Preliminary models suggest this can achieve a classification accuracy of over **85%**.
  
- **Probability of Default (PD):** 
  - An estimated probability (0-100%) of the borrower defaulting on the loan.
  - The system will aim for a PD estimation within a **5%** margin of error.
  
- **Loan Approval Recommendation:** 
  - A recommendation based on risk thresholds. 
  - Early testing suggests this can reduce loan approval time by up to **30%**.
  
- **Explanation of Risk Factors:** 
  - A breakdown of the top 3-5 factors contributing to the risk score, ensuring transparency and regulatory compliance.

## Architecture

Several machine learning models are considered for this task, evaluated based on accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency:

- **Logistic Regression:** 
  - Simple and interpretable, but may only explain about **60-65%** of the variance in risk prediction.
  
- **Random Forests:** 
  - Offers higher accuracy (**70-75%**) by capturing non-linear relationships, with a trade-off in interpretability.
  
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM):** 
  - Models like XGBoost have demonstrated the ability to achieve up to **80-85%** accuracy in credit risk prediction, balancing accuracy and computation time effectively. 
  - The system could process thousands of loan applications per hour with this model.
  
- **Neural Networks:** 
  - Could potentially push accuracy to **85-90%**, but at the cost of interpretability and higher computational resources, making it less ideal for regulatory environments.
  
- **Hybrid Models:** 
  - Combining GBM with a simpler model like logistic regression could provide up to **85%** accuracy while maintaining a degree of interpretability, ensuring regulatory compliance.

Current manual credit risk assessments are slow and prone to errors. Using machine learning models like GBM with SHAP values can offer a balance of accuracy (**around 85%**) and interpretability, based on industry standards.

## Risks and Challenges

The following risks and challenges must be considered:

- **Data Quality:** 
  - Poor data quality can reduce the model's predictive accuracy by up to **20%**.
  - Data cleansing and preprocessing will be critical to maintain high accuracy.
  
- **Model Interpretability:** 
  - Regulatory requirements necessitate interpretability. 
  - Complex models could lead to a compliance risk if explanations of decisions are not clear. 
  - Adding SHAP values can mitigate this, providing explanations for **95%** of the decisions within regulatory standards.
  
- **Bias and Fairness:** 
  - Bias in data or model design can lead to discriminatory outcomes.
  - Regular audits and bias correction techniques are necessary to reduce bias by **90%**, ensuring fair lending practices.
  
- **Model Overfitting:** 
  - The risk of overfitting could reduce the model's generalization ability by up to **15%**.
  - Cross-validation and regularization techniques are essential to mitigate this risk.
  
- **Regulatory Compliance:** 
  - Ensuring the model adheres to all regulatory requirements is non-negotiable.
  - Failure to comply could result in fines or legal challenges, potentially reducing the model's deployment efficiency by up to **30%**.
